# About Me

Thank you for visiting my website, where I share my insights on various topics related to programming, coding languages, and computer science. I hope you find something that sparks your curiosity and interest.

I'm focusing mainly on Compilers, SPV through Blockchain, Hardware emulation, Differentiable programming, and Transformer-based models. As a young developer, I document my learning experience to becoming a better person.
