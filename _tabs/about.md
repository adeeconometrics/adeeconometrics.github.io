# About Me 



Hi, I'm Dave. Welcome to my site where I mostly blog about programming techniques, programming languages, and computer science-related things that I find interesting. 



I am a Computer Science undergrad specializing in Software Engineering at FEU Institute of Technology.  I spend most of my time exploring Bayesian Computation, Numerical Linear Algebra, and Metaprogramming for designing libraries. This site serves as a form of documentation on stuff that I learned.
