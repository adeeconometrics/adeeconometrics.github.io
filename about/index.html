I’m Dave Amiana, a passionate software engineer specializing in enterprise architecture, automation, and innovative development solutions. With expertise spanning cloud infrastructure, API design, language server development, MCP governance patterns, and AI-powered automation tools, I focus on building scalable, secure, and efficient systems that solve complex real-world challenges. My experience ranges from shaping enterprise MCP governance frameworks and agentic tool use patterns to developing enterprise UI libraries, Ansible automation frameworks with a current focus on building secure, scalable foundations for agentic AI integration at the enterprise level. I’m particularly passionate about creating developer tools and experiences that enhance productivity—whether it’s building language servers for better code assistance, designing API-enabled MCP server patterns with robust authentication layers, or developing automation frameworks that streamline complex workflows. My work bridges the gap between innovative technology and practical enterprise solutions, always with an eye toward maintainability, security, and performance optimization. I believe in the transformative power of well-architected software and the importance of sharing knowledge with the development community. Every project is an opportunity to push boundaries, solve interesting problems, and contribute to the evolving landscape of software engineering. Interests Programming Language Design Algorithms Design Compiler and Interpreters High-performance computation User Experience and Design Philosophy Experience Integrations Engineer - IT Foundations, Chevron Jul 2025 - Present As one of the enterprise’s earliest adopters of MCP tooling, actively contributed to shaping the MCP governance landscape by establishing foundational security patterns and standards for safe, scalable agentic automation: Authentication &amp; credential management: Designed an API-enabled MCP server pattern with RBAC and SSO authentication layer transported via SSE/HTTP, serving as a foundation for secure machine-to-service automation enabling interoperable transactions to integrate with MCP agents (Innovation Initiative). Operational governance &amp; compliance: Evolved the initiative by establishing gateway standards for publishing MCP tools in isolated Docker environments, enforcing inbound/outbound traffic governance, and implementing security scanning of third-party and custom tools to ensure compliance with enterprise security standards before production deployment (Active Proposals). Improved global networking &amp; security posture by implementing the Azure Frontdoor Standard/Premium Ansible Role for enterprise workloads which helped consolidate global edge routing, modern WAF policies, and TLS termination enabling up to ~45% TCO reduction in target scenarios while strengthening threat protection. Strengthened Application Gateway and WAF security posture across multiple impact surfaces: Transport-layer hardening: Enforced HTTPS-only traffic controls across backend pools, listeners, and health probes, eliminating plaintext transmission vectors and closing a class of transport-layer vulnerabilities across enterprise-facing infrastructure. Configuration governance: Migrated embedded WAF configurations to a centralized WAF Policy framework, reducing enterprise configuration drift, improving operational maintainability, and hardening the platform security surface through consistent, centrally managed firewall governance. Led product-line engineering initiatives across a portfolio of 90+ Ansible roles servicing approximately 80% of the enterprise platform—establishing developer guardrails against security anti-patterns, enforcing standards compliance, and building platform resilience ahead of accelerated agentic AI integrations. Designed the system such that automated agents are constrained to validate proposed changes against standards before reaching production, ensuring bad code is caught at the gate rather than discovered in operations. Led the early development of an Ansible roles toolchain for monitoring the current state of the product portfolio, extrapolating dependency and usage data for impact analysis, and proactively planning migration and deprecation paths for anticipated Azure resource announcements—enabling data-driven product decisions and significantly reducing the reactive maintenance burden across the enterprise platform. Software Engineer - IT Foundations, Chevron Feb 2024 - Jul 2025 Developed frontend library components for an Enterprise UI library to support Python-Dash and render dashboards in native enterprise design language. Enhanced user experience and consistency across enterprise dashboards, improving data visualization and decision-making. Developed Enterprise language servers for Ansible Roles enabling autodoc, eager validation, code suggestions, and roles generation from the Azure Resource Manager Spec. Streamlined the development process for Ansible Roles, reducing errors and increasing productivity through automated documentation and validation. Developed an internal Python module to automate API load testing in simulating medium and high network traffic testing for scalability and reliability of implementing the cloud architecture. This initiative ensured cloud architecture could handle varying levels of network traffic and emulated user behavior before release, improving its robustness and reliability for servicing enterprise applications. Designed improvements for integration tests on PaaS Ansible roles, focusing on Web-Queue Worker and N-tier architectures. Improved reliability and performance of PaaS solutions, ensuring robust and scalable architectures for enterprise applications. Worked on GenAI to enable code assist in writing Enterprise Ansible Playbooks. Designed and implemented the RAG solution with local inferencing to reduce computational cost by a significant margin (from 16GB model size to 600MB). Significantly reduced computational costs, enabling efficient and cost-effective development of Ansible Playbooks, and enhancing overall productivity. Software Engineering &amp; GIS Analyst Intern, Chevron Software Engineering Intern - IT Foundations &amp; Geospatial Information Systems Aug 2023 - Nov 2023 Worked on writing a Python library to automate geospatial data governance with ArcGIS Dashboards integratation, autodoc CI pipeline, and reusable components which streamlined geospatial data management, improved data accuracy, and enhanced decision-making through automated governance and real-time dashboard updates. Worked on a PowerPlatform tool to automate stale branch deletion, notify stakeholders with existing stale branches, and enable batch deletion. This initiative resulted into increased repository cleanliness, reduced manual maintenance efforts, and improved collaboration by keeping the codebase up-to-date and free of obsolete branches. Software Engineering Intern - IT Foundations May 2023 - Aug 2023 Worked on the enterprise model web application showcasing the best practices in Cloud architecture, API design, and web components as the new standard for the enterprise web apps. This initiative established a new standard for enterprise web apps, promoting scalability, maintainability, and efficient cloud integration. Worked on .NET 6 migration for an enterprise library to digitize and augment the process field workers further enhancing the efficiency and productivity of field workers by providing modernized tools and streamlined workflows. Conducted comprehensive testing of the container apps Ansible role to enable containerized app deployments.
